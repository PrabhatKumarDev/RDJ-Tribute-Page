                <p>The Futurist is the debut studio album by American actor Robert Downey Jr., produced by Jonathan Elias and Mark Hudson, and released on November 23, 2004 through Sony Classical. The album debuted at number 121 on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 16,000 copies in its first week.</p>
                <p>The album received mixed reviews, but Downey stated in 2006 that he probably will not do another album, as he felt that the energy he put into doing the album was not compensated. He explained that he did not want to spend whatever time he had at home in the studio, but rather with his family. "Broken" plays during the end credits to Downey's 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.</p>

                    <p>Downey was born April 4, 1965 in Manhattan, New York, the son of writer, director and filmographer Robert Downey Sr. and actress Elsie Downey (née Elsie Ann Ford). Robert's father is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one quarter Hungarian Jewish, and one quarter Irish, descent, while Robert's mother was of English, Scottish, German, and Swiss-German ancestry. Robert and his sister, Allyson Downey, were immersed in film and the performing arts from a very young age, leading Downey Jr. to study at the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center in upstate New York, before moving to California with his father following his parents' 1978 divorce. In 1982, he dropped out of Santa Monica High School to pursue acting full time. Downey Sr., himself a drug addict, exposed his son to drugs at a very early age, and Downey Jr. would go on to struggle with abuse for decades.</p>
                    <p>Downey Jr. made his debut as an actor at the age of five in the film Pound (1970), written and directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr.. He built his film repertoire throughout the 1980s and 1990s with roles in Tuff Turf (1985), Weird Science (1985), True Believer (1989), and Wonder Boys (2000) among many others. In 1992, Downey received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA (British Academy Award) for Best Actor for his performance in the title role of Chaplin (1992).</p>

                    <p>Despite his active drug and alcohol addiction, Downey Jr. made a name for himself as a young actor in the mid- to late ‘80s. After a season in the cast of “Saturday Night Live,” he scored film roles in the likes of John Hughes fare such as Weird Science, and he co-starred opposite Molly Ringwald in The Pick-Up Artist in 1987. That same year, Downey also gave a memorable performance in the film adaptation of the Bret Easton Ellis novel Less Than Zero, playing a rich kid whose life went off the rails amid a severe heroin addiction. Downey’s off-screen life would soon uncannily resemble that role.</p>
                    <p>Downey’s performance in the 1992 biopic Chaplin earned him an Academy Award nomination, and his career seemed to be on an upward trajectory until 1996, when he was arrested for possession of heroin and cocaine. As reported in a 2003 interview with the New York Times, Downey was arrested multiple times for drug offences and cycled in and out of jail.</p>

                  <p>One of the more disturbing incidents involved an intoxicated Downey wandering into a neighbor’s house and passing out in a bed. After repeatedly missing court ordered drug tests, Downey was sentenced to a three-year prison stint in 1999, but only ended up serving a year in California Substance Abuse Treatment Facility and State Prison.</p>
                  <p>In 2001, while on parole, Downey was found barefoot, wandering around Culver City, California and was arrested on suspicion of being under the influence. That incident led to him being fired from his role on the TV show “Ally McBeal,” in addition to other film and stage jobs. Instead of being sent back to prison, the now-broke actor was ordered to rehab.</p>

                  <!-- <p>Downey’s wife Susan Downey (née Levin) told Harper’s Bazaar that he quit drugs for good in 2003 after she gave him an ultimatum. Apparently, it stuck. According to a 2013 Daily Mail article, the actor credits a combination of 12-step programs, yoga, meditation and therapy with keeping him sober.</p> -->
                  <p>His career didn’t pick up again until Mel Gibson personally underwrote Downey’s liability insurance…</p>
                  <p>He also credits sobriety for the phenomenal career momentum he has enjoyed over the past few years. In the early aughts, it was practically impossible for Downey to get hired since most filmmakers wouldn’t—or couldn’t—pay the exorbitant insurance bonds it required to have him on set. His career didn’t pick up again until Mel Gibson personally underwrote Downey’s liability insurance so that the actor could star in 2003’s The Singing Detective.</p>
                  <p>From there, Downey started working steadily, appearing in films such as Gothika, A Scanner Darkly, Zodiac and Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang.</p>
                  <p>Downey’s star-power rose in 2008 when he starred in the summer blockbusters Iron Man and Tropic Thunder, earning his second Oscar nomination for the latter. Downey then starred in The Avengers and subsequent Iron Man movies, making him a critical player for Marvel.</p>
                  <!-- <p>The fact that Robert Downey Jr.’s career seems to improve the longer he stays sober makes his comeback one of the most impressive and inspiring stories.</p> -->
